Outsourcing Your IT Services Many fastgrowing businesses are outsourcing their IT services to improve company focus and reduce the strain on internal IT resources With technology changing at a rapid rate it makes sense to supplement your inhouse IT department or to fully outsource your IT requirements There are many benefits to partnering with a Managed IT Services provider MSP Here are eight key benefits to outsourcing your IT services 8 Key Benefits to Outsourcing Your IT Services 1 Improve efficiency By accessing the expertise and resources of a top tier professional MSP this gives your business freedom to focus on your core business If you do have an inhouse IT team you can improve efficiency by outsourcing tasks that take up the most time like maintenance backups and disaster recovery and cybersecurity training That way they can focus on delivering outcomes that drive business value 2 Minimise the risk of disasters Having a solid disaster recovery plan is imperative for any business Its a musthave for when any kind of IT downtime strikes The downtime can be from software and hardware errors human error natural disasters or from cyberattacks Is your organisation prepared for a disasternbsp 3 247 helpdesk and proactive monitoring IT Managers today are continually forced to do more with less Its just not realistic for them to provide 247 support By engaging a Managed Services Provider you can give your IT Manager the support they need knowing full well that your business has the support of the MSP day and night allyear roundnbsp 4 Knowledge Redundancy Too often businesses are dependent upon one or two IT staff who have all the knowledge on their IT systems In the case of unexpected absence this can really put business operations at risk By using an outsourced partner you can ensure you have knowledge redundancy as well as scalability so they can help at a moments notice It is not uncommon for MSPs to step in and cover staff holidays and other absenteeism Another advantage to outsourcing is that you can leverage the MSPs approach to system documentation and password management That way the knowledge is not left in someones head 5 Improved IT security As reported in the PWC SEO Survey in 2017 IT security is a big concern amongst Australian CEOs and executives Eightypercent of Australian CEOs are concerned about cyber threatsnbsp Approximately 8 of Australian businesses are ahead of the curve adopters and leaders when it comes to data protection With this in mind the best IT MSPs provide complete security solutions These includenbspnetwork securitynbspcybersecurity awareness training penetration testing vulnerability assessments and more 6 Knowledge base Outsourcing can give you access to capabilities otherwise not accessible or affordable An MSP has an entire team available to tackle just about any issue that may arise At Huon IT we have approximately 30 years experience and we offer access to our wide range of specialist teams including cloud and server support security and networking teams strategic consultants and more 7 Comprehensive reporting When you outsource your managed IT services you will also receive monthly reporting Insight into your activity is vital to know what issues have been resolved and where issues occur more frequently 8 Economies of scale MSPs invest in skills and software to do tasks often repetitive such as patching on a high volume As such the tasks are completed more quickly efficiently and safely Its also more costeffective to outsource than invest in the systems internally nbsp Outsourcing your IT whether its fully or partially outsourced will not only save you money but also ensure that you start each day with confidence knowing that you have 247 support and

impact of COVID19 means that many businesses in Australia and globally now have employees working remotely While many organisations have eased into remote working there are still a number of businesses using processes that have manual printed or facetoface components Document signing is perhaps the best example of this An added obstacle is that not all employees have access to hard copies or printers at home So what options are available to organisations One of the quickest and easiest solutions your business can implement is that of electronic signatures What are the key benefits of electronic signatures 1 Faster turnaround A digitally signed product can be sent in minutes not days Think about the time it takes to print off a document organise a courier to pick it up and have the signed document returned 2 A higher level of security Adobe Sign for example is certified compliant with the worlds most rigorous security standards and it complies with a wide range of privacy regulations Not only this but an electronic signature contains traceable information such as who signed it and when they signed it You can also lock the file so that the document cannot be tampered

to Identify a Scam Email Australian businesses reported more than 5800 scams in 2018 with losses exceeding 72 million Much of this increase comes from the sophisticated business email compromise scams There are some simple tips every business can follow to help reduce the risk of being impacted by these phishing scams Here are our top 10 tips for identifying a scam email 1 Compare the senders display name against their email domain Fraudulent emails can appear legitimate because most user inboxes only present the display name which can be faked Dont trust this hover over the address in the From header to ensure the senders domain is as you would expect 2 Look but dont click Hover your mouse over any links embedded in the body of the email If the link address looks odd dont click on it If you want to test the link open a new window and type in the website address directly rather than clicking on the link from the unsolicited email 3 Check for spelling mistakes Reputable organisations generally do not have major spelling mistakes or questionable grammar Read your emails carefully and if you identify anything suspicious then report immediately to your IT team 4 Analyse the salutation Most organisations will now personalise their email communications with you so be aware if theyve got your name wrong or use generic terms like Valued Customer or Dear Customer when receiving emails 5 Dont give out personal information Legitimate banks and most other companies will never ask for personal credentials via email Dont provide this type of information over email 6 Beware of urgent or threatening language in the subject line A commonly used phishing tactic is to create a sense of fear among users Remain alert with subject lines or content that claim your account has been suspended or your account has had an unauthorised login attempt It is always best to phone your providers main phone line directly to verify rather than following links or using phone numbers included in the email 7 Review the signature Respectable companies always provide contact details in their email signatures If key details are missing this strongly suggests the potential for a phishing attack 8 Dont open suspicious attachments If youre suspicious of an email or you werent expecting to receive an email attachment do not open the file 9 Dont believe everything you see Err on the side of caution when opening and clicking on your emails Just because an emails branding language and information seem correct always take a questioning attitude and dont open anything that looks suspicious no matter how legitimate it looks 10 If in doubt speak with an expert It is always better to be safe than sorry If you notice something that doesnt look right please check with your IT team before you open an email attachment or click on a link They will be able to analyse the email and advise if it is safe or not Of course prevention is always better than cure At Huon IT we offer an

With Worksite 93 now supporting Office 2016 and Windows 10 many clients are wondering what are the benefits apart from the hidden backend benefits to upgrading Outlined below are seven reasons why your business should upgrade to iManage Work 10 1 Simplicity The iManage Work 10 platform has been built from the ground up as a web application which makes the user interface simple and intuitive as well as easytouse across devices and platforms The replication of commonly used UX design and functions from common internet applications reduces the training needs for upgrades and it increases user adoption 2 Smart Software Some examples of how this smart software enhances user productivity include Timelines there is an easy to view timeline that shows users prior versions and a summary of how a document has evolved Activities this view separates the Document History based on individual activities such as Edit View and Print Users Provides a list of users who have accessed the document and displays their individual actions List Shows a standard list of all activities in reverse chronological order Versions Shows the document history for each version Source imanagecom Previews Documents are now previewed one page at a time rather than needing to download the whole document at once which was cumbersome on slow connections and mobile devices Suggested Filing Location has drastically improved This means time is saved by automatically filing items to their correct matter with the automatic tracking of Email Threads 3 Sharing Files Folders and Matters can now be shared internally and externally using HTTPS links This means that there is no more need for an external webserver to share iManage Documents and no need for applications to have an NRL parser for eg mobile devices and external parties to view documents You can also now preview NRL documents before sending Users using iManage Share can click on Workspaces with a Share folder and it will automatically redirect users to the iManage Share Login Page 4 Search iManage Work 10 has now moved away from the old IDOL search to use RAVN Elasticsearch which improves performance and reduces costs associated with indexing documents by up to 40 This can now be used to index repositories such as Network Share Locations Intranets and Websites that unifies the companies search into a single fully indexed tool iManage Work 10 introduces ServerSide Refiling which means no more confusing icons and time wasted waiting for things to be filed RAVN has an Artificial Intelligence AI platform to perform techniques such as Extract Automatically program the indexer to source specific documents and list the information for the user without having to go through the whole document Classify Let your indexer automatically classify specific documents for retention disposal and security Insight Insight into users search behaviour brings more relevant search results 5 Data Loss Prevention Threat management in iManage can now perform Data Loss Prevention which you may have seen in other cloud applications such as Office 365 This feature alerts any events which can leave the company with internal or external data loss An algorithm scores at risk behaviour to ensure that resources are spent on alerts that are most likely to be malicious activity With comprehensive reports interactive graphs reports and visualizations organizations can demonstrate to clients that proper controls are in place to safeguard privileged information Source imanagecom iManage Work 10 Web Client can be configured to enforce a Data Leakage Policy DLP Two options are available 1 Low default All functionality is available to end users 2 High The following functionality is not available to end users Users cannot download documents Users cannot download email attachments In the Share document by email dialogue the option to attach a document to the email is disabled if a user forwards an email 6 Inbuilt Mobility Server Previous versions of iManage needed an additional server for mobility devices and clients to be able to communicate with iManage adding to license and server costs However in iManage Work 10 the mobility functionality is now built in 7 Integration with Cloud Email Platforms iManage 10 Work now fully integrates into Web platforms such as Gmail and Office 365 This means that customers who uses these technologies can utilise the iManage Work 10 Cloud in the same manner To find out more feel free to contact us Author Paris Wells Senior Consultant Huon IT

and Why Is It Important How effective is your current security system against a realworld targeted attack Ask yourself the following questions Would your data be of use to your competitors Would your company survive if a cybercriminal extracted sensitive information and held it for ransom Could you continue to run your business if your systems were compromised Its no longer enough to put security tools into place and hope for the best One of the most important tools that companies can use to defend themselves from cyber attacks is that of penetration testing What is a penetration test A penetration test also known as a pen test is an authorised hacking attempt that simulates realworld attack techniques used by a criminal hacker Even with the most advanced cybersecurity protection technologies in place its the blindspot vulnerabilities that can expose your business Penetration testing is an external security check compared with vulnerability assessments which are an internal security check An impartial thirdparty will test the strength and integrity of your security for all your web exposed elements including IP addresses Websites Infrastructure No security system is guaranteed to be impenetrable but hopefully yours is strong enough to deter cybercriminals Why is a penetration test important The goal of a professional or amateur hacker is to steal information from your business They may be after money or to simply sabotage your company The benefits of penetration testing are numerous Here are a few 1 It provides an independent perspective on your security It is often the case that those businesses that have internal IT teams never get a second opinion However the issue with not getting a second opinion is that you can be left with the blindspots mentioned earlier A fresh pair of eyes will reveal vulnerabilities that are overlooked 2 It will save you money Avoiding the financial costs and damage to your brand equity that can result from having your systems compromised According to a survey by Webroot in 2017 Australian businesses that employ between 100500 employees can expect to shell out approximately 19 million if hit by a cyberattack 3 It will help you comply with Australias data breach laws In February 2018 a Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme was introduced to regulate entities about eligible data breaches By conducting a penetration test you will be ensuring your company is in full compliance with the new data breach notification laws 4 You will proactively improve your organisations IT systems against malicious attacks According to Norton over half a million small businesses in Australia fell victim to cybercrime in 2017nbsp Its no longer enough for businesses to do the bare minimum when it comes to security By completing a penetration test you will receive a report that highlights where your defences are weakest This way you can channel funds to areas most required 5 You may be able to detect vulnerabilities automated scanning software cant While a penetration test may involve the use of automated tools the focus is ultimately on the individual or team of testers and the experience they bring to the test in the context of an attack on your organisation How often should penetration tests be conducted Its recommended that you conduct a pen test approximately every 612 months or each time you make modifications to your network infrastructure Ongoing testing is the most effective With so much at stake its good business sense to protect your business Contact us today to chat about how we can help For more

Phishing vs Whaling Phishing scams are the most common scam impacting Australians Australians lost more money to scammers in 2017 than in any other year since reporting began by the ACCC So what is phishing A phishing scam is where users are asked to divulge sensitive information such as usernames passwords and credit card details Examples include fake security notice warnings where users are warned about unusual login activity These messages pretend to come from legitimate businesses normally banks other financial institutions eg PayPal or telecommunication providers The phishing scams can look extremely sophisticated and convincing There is usually some form of calltoaction tricking us into divulging sensitive personal information such as passwords or bank details There are several types of phishing scams In this post well look at the difference between two common types spear phishing and whaling nbsp Spear phishing Spear phishing is a much more targeted attack in which hackers know which specific individuals or organisations they are after While phishing casts a wide net and hopes to gather data from a wide set of people spear phishing is an attempt to gather data from an identified target Spear phishers are after valuable data such as confidential information and business secrets The cyber criminals do research on the target to make the attack more personalised and to increase their chance of success Think of spear phishing as professional phishing nbsp Whaling Whaling follows on from the idea of spear phishing The key difference is that the targets are even more carefully selected They are often senior executives such as CEOs or CFOs as they have complete access to sensitive data Its called whaling because of the size of the targets relative to those of typical phishing scams This type of scam is also known as CEO Fraud or Executive Fraud Whaling attacks are more difficult to detect than typical phishing attacks because they are so highly personalised and are only sent to the selected target within an organisation Download our Executive Fraud Response Checklist here nbsp How to avoid phishing scams You may not be able to prevent your staff from being targeted by cyber criminals but there are steps you can take to reduce the likelihood that these attacks will be successful One of the most important steps you can take is to educate

Dashboards Can Benefit Your Organisation When you operate a business efficiency is everything Crucial to this is accessing organizational insights to help you make more timely and accurate decisions With a customized business intelligence solution backed by Microsoft Power BI you can bring together data from your disparate lineofbusiness systems and visualize it clearly and easily via prebuilt dashboards Here are five ways that a quality power BI dashboard can benefit your organization 1 Centralise your data into one clear solution Today many organizations operate with huge amounts of data However much of the data sits in disparate systems and there is a lack of a centralised perspective Power BI can bridge this gap by collating overlaying and presenting data from all areas of the business and presenting it via userfriending graphs charts and tables Data can be sourced from a raft of applications including those that are onpremise in the cloud or even on a hybrid infrastructure With a single view of your data you can make timelier and more accurate decisions based on overarching insight Read how RSL Lifecare implemented a centralised solution for their organisation using Power BI 2 Keep you focused on the important metrics Gathering insights from your data is easy with Power BIs simple draganddrop user experience You can quickly find the insights you are looking for and visualize them in beautiful interactive reports Once you have created your report you can save it to your personal dashboard Here you can see the data and metrics that are most important to you and your business 3 Streamline your reporting and compliance Companies are under more pressure than ever before to meet governmental compliance and regulatory requirements Responding to these demands takes time and effort and the burden falls heaviest on smaller organisations which dont necessarily have the resources or budget to respond accordingly However with a customized business intelligence solution you can get the insights you need via your Power BI dashboard You can simply query your data by typing in natural language questions to produce reports relevant to specific compliance requirements and automate your information gathering process saving considerable time and effort 4 Prevent problems from escalating With a Power BI dashboard in place you can identify problems before they escalate and start affecting your customers employees or your overall organisational productivity By integrating financial and operational data for instance you can easily compare costs with operational costs For example an aged care organization could compare care costs with operational costs such as catering cleaning laundry property and maintenance utilities and more Or by integrating data from an employee scheduling system you can get ataglance insights on a range of staffrelated information such as qualifications roles absenteeism allowances and skills mix With Power BIs customization you can also ensure that managers within your organization have the information thats relevant to them For example your CFO could receive highlevel insights related to your overall financial performance fluctuations in operating costs and income overall staff costs variances in equipment costs and other outgoings and more 5 Mobilise your workforce With a cloudbased business intelligence solution in place your managers can get the insights they need from any device at any time which means they are no longer tied to their desks By removing the need to regularly return to a central location to access key information employees can work more effectively and respond more quickly nbsp At Huon IT we specialise in business analytics and provide fully customized business

care sector becomes more complex and competitive technology is playing an increasingly vital role With the right technology in place general managers chief executive officers and chief financial offers can generate insights improve staff retention and ultimately deliver better outcomes for the people in their care To shed more light on future proofing the aged care sector with technology our CEO and aged care technology expert Damian Huon shares his thoughts Q What do you see as the main challenges for the sector right now A There are really three major challenges that we see in our role as a technology consultant to the sector The first is the lack of an effective digital ecosystem across aged care The entire sector is becoming increasingly digitised from clinical records to rostering to billings data to scheduling to medicine dispensing processes Technology is exploding within aged care but there is still no single silver bullet solution Most of the clients we work with have several bestofbreed applications in place but there is no real ability to correlate or crossreference the data from these applications and no single source of truth Of course this challenge isnt unique to aged care The second major challenge is the lack of agility Many of the systems we see are archaic and ineffective While there are all kinds of innovations coming into the sector such as IoT Internet of Things wearables to improve patient care organisations wont be able to embrace them unless their overall infrastructure is up to the task As part of this theres a trend towards community care as more people dont want to retire in facilities but receive services in their own home This creates a large mobile workforce and delivers associated IT challenges More than ever its important for organisations to be highly efficient develop lean administration and operations at once to embrace change and combat funding cuts And thirdly theres the issue of compliance and governance Theres an increasing regulatory burden for aged care providers which means more and more information must be collated and supplied to regulatory bodies This takes time and effort and is a particularly significant burden for smaller organisations We believe this is one of the reasons they are being swallowed up by larger firms its simply too hard to keep up Q Why is Business Intelligence or analytics so crucial in this space A Currently we see a landscape of different technology both across the sector as a whole and within different organisations Most of the clients we work with have a large number of applications often best of breed lineofbusiness applications The advantage of business analytics is that we can correlate that data link it together in a meaningful way and provide useful analytics reporting From a CIO perspective harnessing that data and the knowledge within that data is crucial for an aged care organisation to ensure its on the right charter and going forward focusing on the right activities Business Intelligence tools offer a huge competitive advantage While integrated data isnt yet a reality for most aged care businesses or most businesses generally a Business Intelligence solution thats backed by Power BI can bridge the gaps bringing information together for meaningful insight Q Do you have an everyday example of how an aged care practice can use a Power BI dashboard A Often aged care businesses have a nurse call system and a rostering system and typically they are completely disparate However through business analytics we can identify trends between these data sets and provide insights in a visual way This can help managers to focus on what they need to focus on to run the business and make good decisions about care staffing levels and overall productivitynbsp Q What are the benefits of business analytics for an aged care institution A There are all kinds of great benefits It can help workers at all levels to make faster and more accurate decisions It can improve care and reduce waiting times for residents due to improved efficiency and more streamlined rostering And all of this can also lead to increased profitability and time savings across the organisation The more streamlined reporting and compliance process is also a huge benefit and time saving for organisations particularly smaller ones that need to be more judicious with their resource allocationnbsp Business intelligence provides managers with the realtime easy to understand and relevant data they need to manage proactivelynbsp You cant manage what you dont know Power BI brings obvious data into the spotlight and also shines a light on items that sometimes fall through the cracks from regulatory questions such as the dates staff police checks need renewing to the quality of life questions like how many residents belong to a particular religion or share similar hobbiesnbsp Imagine how this kind of information could be used to help your residents more easily meet and make friends and the ensuing quality of life improvements Q Who does a Business Intelligence solution benefit A A Business Intelligence and analytics solution has a wide range of potential benefits across the organisation It provides a broad set of dashboards that are either role or regionally based So a CEO might have different interests to a nursing manager or a general manager of facilities or the chief operating officer Essentially we help create customised dashboards for different roles so everyone has the insight they need Q What about the compliance and regulatory aspect How can Business Intelligence help A Meeting increasing government regulations and requirements are becoming a significant administrative overhead in the aged care sector For a start theres the need for organisations to continually report on the qualifications of their staff If youre managing 2000 employees its vital to ensure they have all completed police checks done their first aid or completed necessary qualifications If you fail to meet any of these requirements you can get funding pulled which can be a significant source of revenue Its what aged care organisations dont know that will catch them The more they can get on their dashboard the more they can get alerted before problems escalate Q Why is Huon IT ideally placed to help A Huon IT has been around for almost 30 years and we have been working in the aged care sector for the last decade We work across a large number of aged care clients from large notforprofits to smaller privately owned facilities We also have an indepth knowledge of Power BI and have the inhouse skills to provide aged care practices with robust reliable and customised solutions to help them operate more effectively

good time to take stock of the IT priorities set to dominate the year ahead Based on discussions weve been having with our own clients across Australia wed thought wed share the top five IT trends were seeing for 201718 FY How does your organisations IT strategy stack up 1 Security security security Last financial year rounded out with some major cyber security crises on a neverbeforeseen global scale including WannaCry and Petya which had devastating impacts on both public and private businesses across every continent Unfortunately such threats arent going anywhere and were likely to see even more in the year ahead So beefing up your IT security should be an absolute top priority this year Check that your IT security strategy includes Acknowledgment by management that cyber security is not just an IT matter it is a wider business priority Whilst IT tends to be the default custodian its vitally important that the business itself recognises the true risk to their reputation continuity and assets should the worst occur Strategic assessment of your business cybersecurity maturity posture using an appropriate framework such as National Institute of Standards amp Technology NIST or ISO guidelines Technical reviews including penetration testing Bring the security consideration into every IT Project will security be improved or weakened by the proposed change and what needs compliance checks postchange Best practice IT management procedures such as regular patching and system updates Strong system defences including business grade antivirus firewalls with threat management features and data encryption User awareness training to educate your users on safe behaviours and how to identify email scams No matter how sophisticated your systems are an unwitting user can still unintentionally expose your business to risk through clicking a malicious link or downloading an attachment Risk aware staff are your best line of defence 2 Harness the potency of Business Intelligence BI As data stacks up all around us finding how to actually analyse it for smarter business management and decision making is an opportunity too potent to pass up Business intelligence BI platforms such as Microsoft Power BI now part as Office 365 are changing the way many organisations approach thinking about their business No longer needing a degree in data analytics any manager can see at a glance business trends warning signs and important statistics to their hearts content via visual customised dashboards amp live reports Able to draw upon any private dataset via your database apps and other systems together with any relevant public data maps reports and repositories the sky is the limit In fact one of our aged care clients RSL LifeCare has completely transformed their business with this platform check out the case study here 3 Connecting your various Cloud apps As many businesses look toward software as a service for several of their line of business applications whether it be sales marketing finance or HR your once centralised dataset may have now become quite disparate across your providers clouds Huon IT are seeing a rise in the need for Cloud app integration to pull various softwares as service together so that data integrity remains intact and that interdepartmental workflows continue to run smoothly Platforms such as Azure offer affordable solutions which require minimal development compared to the notoriously expensive middlewares previous relied on 4 Single sign on for all your applications On the topic of having several apps for different parts of your business the challenges dont stop with data integrity Different log ins for each app can be a big pain for users to remember and an even bigger amp riskier pain for IT to administer Maintaining control over applications is key to a safe efficient business Solutions such as Microsofts Azure Active Directory service part of the Enterprise Mobility Suite provides a powerful set of cloudbased identity and access management solutions This allows employees to have a single username and password to a centralised access interface rather than having separate log ins for each separate app and IT can enable additional levels of validation including multifactor authentication conditional access policies and monitor unusual or suspicious activity An added bonus is that when any user leaves IT simply needs to shut down their single log in Theres no risk of the user sharing or keeping credentials to separate applications nbsp 5 The importance of the CIO role reigns supreme As the line between business and IT continues to blur technology expertise at the executive level is more critical than ever No longer simply a cost centre hidden in the back room technology has the ability to make or break a companys success Responding to market changes keeping up with the competition and ensuring your techsavvy customers are happy relies on more than just stable IT systems it needs true innovation which is an ongoing process requiring both business acumen and deep technical experience Cant afford a fulltime CIO Consider engaging the services of an external firm for CIO as a Service advice which is typically available on either fixed price or ad hoc basis for either short or longer term engagements This provides access to high quality executive innovation at an affordable price point Cheers to successful year ahead Author Damian Huon CEO Huon IT
