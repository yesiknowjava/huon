                <h3>How to Get Support</h3>

<p>A member of our support team will talk with you first to determine the nature of the problem.&nbsp;<br>
Call Support: 1300 HUON SD (4866 73)</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
	Once you are on the phone with a member of our support team, you will be directed back to this page after your support representative provides you with a unique connection code. You will then enter the code in the field below and click the Click Here button to initiate the screen-sharing session.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
	You are prompted to download a small virus-free plug-in.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
	With your permission, your support representative can view your screen and share control of your mouse and keyboard.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>STEP 4:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
	You are in full control of your computer at all times. You always have overriding control of your mouse and keyboard, and you can end the screen-sharing session at any time.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>
