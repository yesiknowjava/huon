<p>Lindsay Rhodes is one of our longest serving Huonites, who has kindly agreed to share his story.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img class="fr-dib fr-fic fr-fil" src="/img/Screen Shot 2017-06-30 at 12.16.20 pm.png" style="float:left; padding-right:15px; width:300px">
	<strong>Who am I?</strong>
	<br>Today I’m a Senior Solutions Advisor in the Sydney Huon IT office. Although my story didn’t begin that way – I started as a cadet consultant, progressing into head of the onsite team, then deciding to try my hand as a solution architect. I’ve now been with Huon for 16 years, however I did spend 2 years in the UK working in an IT firm in London. As soon as I returned back to Australia, I was kindly offered to resume my role again, so here we are over a decade later. My journey from cadet to senior solutions advisor has been an incredible growth opportunity and to be able to do it at one firm is pretty special. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What do I do?</strong>
	<br>I’m not the person to speak to about which buttons to press in an application, I’m far more excited about talking about the big picture IT strategy – I guess my background allows me to talk both technical and business. I really enjoy meeting with clients and understanding what their organisational requirements are around IT and then providing assistance in aligning technology to meet the businesses objectives and direction. Considering my long term experience and awareness of our clients, I quite often work collaboratively with other consulting arms of the Huon IT team to ensure we are creating and delivering the best service to our clients.</p>

<p><strong>What do I enjoy most about my role?</strong>
	<br>Business improvement is one of my passions and to have the opportunity to make a difference every day is great. In my world no day is ever the same, so the shifting challenges keep me on my toes - I love it! Every environment is different in some capacity, while you can bring in industry knowledge or known technologies, it’s really about understanding the unique requirements of each client we work with to ensure we shape to fit in the best way possible. It’s fantastic to work with such a passionate and hardworking team while also enjoying social activities such as my favourite Tennis.&nbsp;</p>
