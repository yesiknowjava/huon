                        focused on helping our audience stay up-to-date on current threats.<br><br>

                    <h3>NSA Reveals Severe Flaw in Windows 10</h3>
                    <p><img alt="NSA reveals severe flaw in Windows 10"

                    <p>Microsoft has released a security patch for the severe flaw found by the NSA in its Windows 10
                        operating systems. The flaw was found in the usermode cryptographic library, CRYPT32.DLL, that
                        affects Windows 10 systems. As stated by the NSA, "exploitation of the vulnerability allows
                        attackers to defeat trusted network connections and deliver executable code while appearing as
                        legitimately trusted entities."<br><br>
                        It is advised that you apply the latest patches as quickly as possible. If you need help to
                        protect your business data, contact Huon IT. For more information,&nbsp;<a

                    <p>Citrix has issued its first set of patches fixing a flaw identified as&nbsp;<a
                            href="https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027"
                            rel="nofollow">CVE-2019-19781</a>&nbsp;on 17 December 2019.<br><br>
                        This flaw affected Citrix’s Application Delivery Controller (ADC) load and application balancer,
                        and the Citrix Gateway Virtual Private Network (VPN) appliance (previously known as the
                        NetScaler ADC or NetScaler Gateway).<br><br>
                        As the vulnerability already has a working PoC, it's critical that the updates are installed.

                    <p>Permanent fixes for ADC versions 11.1 and 12.0 are available as downloads. Fixes will be
