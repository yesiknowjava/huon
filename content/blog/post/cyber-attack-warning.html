    <p><strong>Last week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia was being hit with a massive cyber
            attack by a foreign government.</strong></p>
    <p>Mr Morrison advised that this activity was “targeting Australian organisations across a range of sectors,
        including all levels of government, industry, political organisations, education, health, essential service
        providers, and operators of other critical infrastructure.”</p>
    <h3>How the Attacks are Happening</h3>
    <p>As shown below, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has identified the spearphishing techniques being

    <h3>The following three steps have been recommended for urgent attention:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>That businesses patch internet-facing devices promptly by making sure that any web or email servers are
            fully updated with the latest software.</li>
        <li>Ensure that multi-factor authentication is used to secure&nbsp;Internet access, infrastructure, and
            cloud-based platforms.</li>
        <li>Become an <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/">ACSC member</a> to ensure you get the latest cyber threat
            advice to protect your organisation online.</li>
