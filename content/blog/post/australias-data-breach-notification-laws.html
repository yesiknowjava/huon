                    <p>According to the passage of the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017, on the
                        23rd of&nbsp;February, any eligible data breaches will need to be reported to the Office of the
                        Australian Information Commissioner and individuals effected.</p>
                    <p><strong>What is an eligible data breach?</strong><br>
                        The scheme only requires organisations to notify when there is a data breach that is likely to
                        result in serious harm to any individual to whom the information relates.&nbsp;<br>
                        &nbsp;<br>
                        Such as:&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a device containing customersâ€™ personal information is lost or stolen</li>
                        <li>a database containing personal information is hacked</li>
                        <li>personal information is mistakenly provided to the wrong person</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>How and When Do I Notify?</strong><br>
                        Where an organisation becomes aware that an eligible data breach has occurred, they are
                        obligated to notify individuals at likely risk of serious harm and the Commissioner as soon as
                        practicable.<br>
                        &nbsp;<br>
                        Information that should be provided to both parties:&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the identity and contact details of the organisation</li>
                        <li>a description of the data breach</li>
                        <li>the kinds of information concerned</li>
                        <li>recommendations about the steps individuals should take in response to the data breach</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Reasoning</strong><br>
                        To ensure that individuals can take remedial steps in the event that their personal information
                        is compromised.<br>
                        &nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Penalties</strong><br>
                        A failure to comply with the notification obligations will fall under the Privacy Act's existing
                        enforcement and civil penalty framework. Accordingly, APP Entities may be subject to anything
                        from investigations to, in the case of serious or repeated non-compliance, substantial civil
                        penalties.<br>
                        &nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>How to prepare</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Audit your current information security processes and procedures to ensure they are adequate
                            (prevention will soon be much more palatable than the cure)</li>
                        <li>Prepare a data breach response plan so as to enable the APP Entity to respond quickly,
                            efficiently and lawfully to an actual or suspected data breach</li>
                    </ol>
