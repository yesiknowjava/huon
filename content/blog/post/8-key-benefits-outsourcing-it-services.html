                    <p>Many fast-growing businesses are outsourcing their IT services to improve company focus and
                        reduce the strain on internal IT resources. With technology changing at a rapid rate, it makes
                        sense to supplement your in-house IT department, or to fully outsource your IT requirements.</p>
                    <p>There are many benefits to partnering with a Managed IT Services provider (MSP). Here are eight
                        key benefits to outsourcing your IT services:</p>
                    <h2><strong>8 Key Benefits to Outsourcing Your IT Services</strong></h2>
                    <h3><strong>1. Improve efficiency</strong></h3>
                    <p style="margin-left:36.0pt !msorm">By accessing the expertise and resources of a top tier
                        professional MSP, this gives your business freedom to focus on your core business.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:36.0pt !msorm">If you do have an in-house IT team, you can improve efficiency
                        by outsourcing tasks that take up the most time (like maintenance, back-ups, and disaster
                        recovery, and cybersecurity training). That way they can focus on delivering outcomes that drive
                        business value.</p>
                    <h3><strong>2. Minimise the risk of disasters</strong></h3>
                    <p style="margin-left:36.0pt !msorm">Having a solid disaster recovery plan is imperative for any
                        business. It’s a must-have for when any kind of IT downtime strikes. The downtime can be from
                        software and hardware errors, human error, natural disasters, or from cyber-attacks.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:36.0pt !msorm">Is your organisation <a
                            href="/what-we-do/cloud/disaster-recovery-service">prepared for a
                            disaster</a>?&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3><strong>3. 24/7 </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>elpdesk and
                        </strong><strong>p</strong><strong>roactive
                        </strong><strong>m</strong><strong>onitoring</strong></h3>
                    <p style="margin-left:36.0pt !msorm">IT Managers today are continually forced to do more with less.
                        It’s just not realistic for them to provide 24/7 support. By engaging a <a
                            href="/what-we-do/managed-services/proactive-monitoring">Managed
                            Services Provider</a>, you can give your IT Manager the support they need knowing full well
                        that your business has the support of the MSP, day and night, all-year round.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3><strong>4. Knowledge Redundancy</strong></h3>
                    <p style="margin-left:36.0pt !msorm">Too often businesses are dependent upon one or two IT staff who
                        have all the knowledge on their IT systems. In the case of unexpected absence, this can really
                        put business operations at risk. By using an outsourced partner, you can ensure you have
                        knowledge redundancy, as well as scalability so they can help at a moment’s notice. It is not
                        uncommon for MSPs to step in and cover staff holidays and other absenteeism.</p>
                    <p>Another advantage to outsourcing is that you can leverage the MSPs approach to system
                        documentation and password management. That way, the knowledge is not left in 'someone's head'.
                    </p>
                    <h3><strong>5. Improved </strong><strong>IT </strong><strong>security</strong></h3>
                    <p style="margin-left:36.0pt !msorm">As reported in the PWC SEO Survey in 2017, IT security is a big
                        concern amongst Australian CEOs and executives. Eighty-percent of Australian CEOs are concerned
                        about cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:36.0pt !msorm">Approximately 8% of Australian businesses are ahead of the
                        curve (adopters and leaders) when it comes to data protection.</p>
                    <p>With this in mind, the best IT MSPs provide complete security solutions. These include&nbsp;<a

                            security</a>,&nbsp;<a

                            assessments</a> and more.</p>
                    <h3><strong>6. Knowledge base</strong></h3>
                    <p style="margin-left:36.0pt !msorm">Outsourcing can give you access to capabilities otherwise not
                        accessible or affordable. An MSP has an entire team available to tackle just about any issue
                        that may arise.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:36.0pt !msorm">At Huon IT, we have approximately 30 years’ experience and we
                        offer access to our wide range of specialist teams including cloud and server support, security
                        and networking teams, strategic consultants and more.</p>
                    <h3><strong>7. Comprehensive reporting</strong></h3>
                    <p>When you outsource your managed IT services, you will also receive monthly reporting. Insight
                        into your activity is vital to know what issues have been resolved and where issues occur more
                        frequently.</p>
                    <h3><strong>8. Economies of scale</strong></h3>
                    <p>MSPs invest in skills and software to do tasks (often repetitive, such as patching) on a high
                        volume. As such, the tasks are completed more quickly, efficiently and safely.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:36.0pt !msorm">It's also more cost-effective to outsource than invest in the
                        systems internally.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Outsourcing your IT, whether it’s fully or partially outsourced, will not only save you money but
                        also ensure that you start each day with confidence knowing that you have 24/7 support and
                        access to a top tier IT service provider.</p>
