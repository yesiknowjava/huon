                    <p>The impact of COVID-19 means that many businesses in Australia (and globally) now have employees
                        working remotely.</p>
                    <p>While many organisations have eased into remote working, there are still a number of businesses
                        using processes that have manual, printed, or face-to-face components. Document signing is
                        perhaps the best example of this.</p>
                    <p>An added obstacle is that not all employees have access to hard copies or printers at home. So,
                        what options are available to organisations?</p>
                    <p>One of the quickest and easiest solutions your business can implement is that of electronic
                        signatures.</p>
                    <h3>What are the key benefits of electronic signatures?</h3>
                    <h4><strong>1. Faster turnaround</strong></h4>
                    <p>A digitally signed product can be sent in minutes, not days. Think about the time it takes to
                        print off a document, organise a courier to pick it up and have the signed document returned.
                    </p>
                    <h4><strong>2. A higher level of security</strong></h4>
                    <p>Adobe Sign, for example, is certified compliant with the world’s most rigorous security standards
                        and it complies with a wide range of privacy regulations. Not only this, but an electronic
                        signature contains traceable information such as who signed it and when they signed it. You can
                        also lock the file so that the document cannot be tampered with or changed.</p>
                    <h4><strong>3. Lower transaction costs</strong></h4>
                    <p>There are obvious cost-savings in time with electronic signatures but there are also cost-savings
                        in paper, printing and copying, and postage costs.</p>
                    <p>Adobe Sign is one of the easiest electronic signature solutions to automate your document
                        workflows on the web, on the phone, or inside your favourite application. It’s fast to deploy
                        and easy to use.</p>
