                    <p>Your employees are frequently exposed to sophisticated phishing and ransomware attacks.
                        Cybersecurity is no longer the sole responsibility of your IT department. It’s everyone’s
                        business.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Every organization is at risk. According to <a
                            href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/email-security-gap-analysis-shows-10-miss-rate"><strong>KnowBe4’s
                                Email Security Gap Analysis</strong></a>, your email filters have a 10.5% failure rate.
                        This means you need a strong human firewall as your last line of defence.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Educating your staff on how to recognize phishing scams and malicious attacks is the key to
                        ensuring your company data remains safe.</p>
                    <p>Here are three reasons why cybersecurity awareness training is important to your business.</p>
                    <h3><strong>1. Cyber-criminals don’t discriminate.&nbsp;</strong></h3>
                    <p>All staff in your organization are at risk of receiving a malicious email. Email scams can take
                        many forms including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Phishing attacks</strong> - where users are asked to divulge sensitive information
                            such as usernames, passwords and credit card details. Examples include fake security notice
                            warnings where users are warned about “unusual log-in activity”.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Spear phishing</strong> – this is a much more targeted attack in which hackers know
                            which specific individuals or organisations they are after. Spear phishers are after
                            valuable data such as confidential information, business secrets etc.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>CEO fraud</strong> – this is a scam in which cybercriminals spoof company email
                            accounts and try and trick an employee in accounting or HR to authorize payments or send out
                            confidential tax information.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3><strong>2. Fast results.</strong></h3>
                    <p>According to KnowBe4, who train six million users worldwide, companies begin with an average of
                        27% phish-prone users. After 90 days on the training program this decreases to 13% on average,
                        and after a year this is reduced to only 2.1%.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>​​​​​<strong>3. Reduced risk.</strong></h3>
                    <p>Without a proper training program for your staff, your business is at risk of not only financial
                        loss through fraud but also business interruption, and damage to your business’s reputation.</p>
