                    <p>Whether you’re in the midst of EOFY planning, approaching a major change in your business, or
                        simply want an independent assessment of your IT systems, an independent IT health check is a
                        key step in IT planning.</p>
                    <h3>What is an IT Health Check?</h3>
                    <p>The aim of an IT health check is to provide a high-level analysis of all IT functions within an
                        organisation including an assessment of the current strengths and weaknesses, and strategic
                        recommendations for the future. Typically, an IT health check will include a review of&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Software licensing &amp; compliance</li>
                        <li>Server and storage infrastructure performance, capacity and configurations</li>
                        <li>Networking infrastructure and design</li>
                        <li>Cloud (private, public or hybrid) review</li>
                        <li>Client facing applications and back-end services</li>
                        <li>IT management methodologies</li>
                        <li>Backup and disaster recovery plans</li>
                        <li>Risk and cybersecurity analysis, and much more.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The results of the assessment are provided in an easy-to-read report that covers insights into
                        the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities across your IT operations, cost structures and
                        future scalability recommendations.</p>
                    <p>The findings of the report will be presented to your team in ‘plain English’ at both a business
                        and technical level.</p>
                    <h3>What are the benefits of an IT Health Check?</h3>
                    <h4>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Independent advice</h4>
                    <p>By engaging an independent provider to conduct your IT assessment, you can gain access to a
                        separate source of strategic and technical skills who can review your strengths, weakness and
                        opportunities objectively.</p>
                    <h4>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assistance with budget forecasting</h4>
                    <p>By reviewing your current IT infrastructure, you can gather meaningful information to help you
                        better plan for future system upgrades. The audit identifies critical needs and areas that need
                        to be remediated. This information can then assist your team with financial planning and
                        prioritisation.</p>
                    <h4>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Identify cost-savings</h4>
                    <p>The end of the financial year is the perfect time to review your hardware status and software
                        licenses. We can track the use of the hardware you have invested in and make more informed
                        decisions to reallocate, repurpose or replace in a more cost-effective manner.</p>
                    <p>Also, you can often save costs by identifying, removing or reallocating software where it’s not
                        needed or used.</p>
                    <h4>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Identify security risks</h4>
                    <p>As part of the review, our technical consultants will review your organisation’s security
                        practices including the strength of your networking infrastructure, your security policies, user
                        permissions, and more. We can also recommend which security assessment or training program will
                        best suit your business.</p>
                    <p>Gaps in your IT security can mean serious downtime, security risks, and lost revenue. Don’t wait
                        until it’s too late!</p>
                    <h4>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Efficiency Improvements</h4>
                    <p>If required, Huon IT can suggest changes to your current infrastructure that will result in
                        improved efficiency.</p>
                    <p>Technology is constantly changing so having a health check can give you peace of mind that you
                        have the right technology and systems in place.</p>
                    <p>- - - - - - - -</p>
                    <p>Keep your finger on the pulse with an independent IT audit so that you can ensure any weakness in
                        your IT system doesn’t undermine your business success. To book in your IT Health Check, <a
