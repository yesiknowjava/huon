                    <p>Webroot recently revealed the results from their 2018 edition of its annual threat report. Here
                        are some of their key findings:</p>
                    <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The polymorphism trend continues. Polymorphism is the
                        process where malicious software changes its underlying code to avoid detection. In 2017, 94% of
                        the malware encountered was seen on only ONE machine. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cryptojacking, the secret use of your computing device to
                        mine cryptocurrency, is gaining traction as a profitable and anonymous attack that requires
                        minimal effort.</p>
                    <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 10 is almost twice as safe as Windows 7. However,
                        the migration rate for enterprises has been quite slow.</p>
                    <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ransomware and its variants has become an even greater
                        threat. WannaCry and NotPetya infected more than 200,000 machines in over 100 countries within
                        24 hours.</p>
                    <p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phishing remains one of the most used and most successful
                        attack vectors. In 2017, 90% of the phishing attacks observed came from a tiny 62 domains. In
                        addition to this, 50 of the unique IPs hosting phishing sites produced over 1.5 million phishing
                        attacks.</p>
                    <p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the hundreds of thousands of new websites created each
                        day in 2017, 25% of URLs were deemed malicious, suspicious, or moderately risky.</p>
