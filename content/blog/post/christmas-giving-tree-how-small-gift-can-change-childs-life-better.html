                    <p>Christmas is not always an easy time of year for some. Based in Curl Curl, Stewart House supports
                        almost 2,000 kids annually providing them with a 12-day stay on beach at no cost to their
                        parents or carers. During their stay these kids are provided with dental, optical, hearing and
                        medical screening treatment, as well as educational programs that are designed to develop their
                        social and emotional skills, build self-esteem and improve their overall wellbeing.</p>
                    <p>A small gift can change a child's life for the better. For Christmas, Stewart House, house over
                        90 kids of all ages and have a Christmas "Giving Tree" where people from the community donate
                        gifts for the children.</p>
                    <p>Since 2016, the Huon IT team have provided gifts to the Stewart House "Giving Tree." This
                        December, the team rallied together again to support and donate a variety of gifts to make
                        Christmas a little brighter for children of all ages who are struggling in the community. Most
                        kids often travel from far and wide to take part in the Stewart House Program and many of them
                        are from disadvantaged backgrounds or isolated areas.</p>
