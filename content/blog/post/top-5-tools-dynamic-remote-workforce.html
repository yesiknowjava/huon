                    <p>With most of us now working from home to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, Huon IT has been
                        flat out helping clients (and our own team) embrace the shift to remote working.</p>
                    <p>During this time, we’ve experienced incredible business transformations at unprecedented rates
                        and gained interesting insights into how the right IT tools can ensure teams are empowered,
                        engaged and effective.<br><br>
                        Here’s a summary of our top five tools for a dynamic remote workforce:</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h4>1. SOFT PHONES</h4>
                    <p>Clumsy forwards to staff mobiles aren’t sustainable in the long term.<br>
                        &nbsp;<br>
                        Cloud-based phone systems allow staff to make and receive calls via headsets on their laptops,
                        or a mobile app. Central consoles provide visibility across which of your staff are available,
                        on calls, offline etc.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h4>2. VIDEO CONFERENCING &amp; CHAT COLLABORATION</h4>
                    <p>The formation of workgroups, meeting rhythms and easy communication channels is key. We suggest
                        Teams for small meetings and persistent chat, as well as streaming live events. Zoom is popular
                        for larger group catch-ups.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h4>3. TO DO LISTS &amp; DOCUMENT COLLABORATION</h4>
                    <p>Office 365 online allows the co-editing of documents in real-time, and Microsoft Planner shares
                        to-do lists and task allocations.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h4>4. ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES</h4>
                    <p>In lieu of printing out contracts and other documents requiring signatures, we’re leveraging
                        Adobe tools to insert electronic signatures.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h4>5. DOCUMENT DIGITISATION, FORMS &amp; WORKFLOW AUTOMATION</h4>
                    <p>Any traditionally paper-based process, such as accounts payable (from printing invoices, stamping
                        and approving, through to processing and payments) can now be done digitally – removing the need
                        for physical document handling.</p>
