                    <p>Password breaches are becoming increasingly common and learning how to protect online accounts is
                        more important than ever.</p>

                    <h3>The Risk</h3>
                    <p>Many people use weak or repeat passwords for ease of remembering, however this means they can be
                        very easy for a hacker to guess.</p>
                    <p>Password reuse is a problem because once itâ€™s been guessed a hacker can potentially use it to
                        access multiple accounts.&nbsp;Ultimately you should be using a unique password for every
                        account.&nbsp;These passwords should be strong, long, and unpredictable and contain numbers and
                        symbols.&nbsp;The problem is the average person now has multiple accounts to keep track
                        of.&nbsp;Remembering strong passwords is almost impossible without writing them down somewhere.
                        This is where a password manager may be a good solution.</p>
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>Password Managers can generate strong, secure, and random passwords then remember and securely
                        store them for you.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Many have the following features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They generate complex, random passwords</li>
                        <li>Automatically log you into websites and accounts</li>
                        <li>Set up two-factor authentication, adding a second step to the login process for extra
                            security</li>
                        <li>Notify you if someone has attempted to use your login details</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Warning When Choosing a Password Manager</h3>
                    <p>Many web browsers offer an integrated password manager, which may seem like a convenient
                        solution. However while&nbsp;these may help to save you time, they may not be the most secure
                        option.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Google for example, already stores an extraordinary amount of information about you, which
                        potentially provides more data to them than you would like.&nbsp; Furthermore, Chrome and
                        Internet Explorer store your passwords on your computer in an unencrypted form. These password
                        files could then be accessed via your computer and used fraudulently.</p>
                    <h3>What to Look For When Selecting a Password Manager</h3>
                    <p>There are many Password Manager options available, so the question is: how do you decide which is
                        the best option for you?</p>
                    <p>Here are some things to consider when choosing the right Password Manager:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Is it Cloud-based? Cloud storage assists with accessibility and convenience.&nbsp; It
                            provides instant backup and there is less chance of losing data in your vault if your hard
                            drive fails.</li>
                        <li>Does it have two-factor authentication?</li>
                        <li>The Password Manager should be able to encrypt your&nbsp;data and the provider should not be
                            able to&nbsp;decrypt your data. This means that even if an employee of the provider manages
                            to access your data, it will convert it to random symbols, letters and numbers rendering it
                            useless.</li>
                        <li>Cost - What options are available for free and which require a membership fee.</li>
                        <li>Ease of use - most solutions will come with a free trial option, it might be worth testing
                            them out before you decide which one to commit to.</li>
                        <li>Does it support mobile devices? Is the experience the same on a mobile device?</li>
                        <li>Another nice to have feature is whether the solution will analyse and notify you of weak or
                            repeated use of the same password.</li>
                    </ol>
