                    <h2>Q&amp;A with Huon IT's CEO, Damian Huon<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
                    <p>As the aged care sector becomes more complex and competitive, technology is playing an
                        increasingly vital role. With the right technology in place, general managers, chief executive
                        officers and chief financial offers can generate insights, improve staff retention, and
                        ultimately, deliver better outcomes for the people in their care.</p>
                    <p>To shed more light on future proofing the aged care sector with technology, our CEO and aged care
                        technology expert, Damian Huon, shares his thoughts.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Q: What do you see as the main challenges for the sector right now?</strong></h3>
                    <p>A: There are really three major challenges that we see in our role as a technology consultant to
                        the sector.</p>
                    <p>The first is the <strong>lack of an effective digital ecosystem</strong> across aged care. The
                        entire sector is becoming increasingly digitised – from clinical records to rostering, to
                        billings data, to scheduling, to medicine dispensing processes.</p>
                    <p>Technology is exploding within aged care, but there is still no single ‘silver bullet’ solution.
                        Most of the clients we work with have several best-of-breed applications in place, but there is
                        no real ability to correlate or cross-reference the data from these applications, and no single
                        source of truth. Of course, this challenge isn’t unique to aged care.</p>
                    <p>The second major challenge is the<strong> lack of agility</strong>. Many of the systems we see
                        are archaic and ineffective. While there are all kinds of innovations coming into the sector –
                        such as IoT (Internet of Things) wearables to improve patient care - organisations won’t be able
                        to embrace them unless their overall infrastructure is up to the task.</p>
                    <p>As part of this, there’s a trend towards community care – as more people don’t want to retire in
                        facilities but receive services in their own home. This creates a large mobile workforce and
                        delivers associated IT challenges. More than ever, it’s important for organisations to be highly
                        efficient, develop lean administration and operations at once to embrace change and combat
                        funding cuts.</p>
                    <p>And thirdly, there’s the<strong> issue of compliance and governance</strong>. There’s an
                        increasing regulatory burden for aged care providers, which means more and more information must
                        be collated and supplied to regulatory bodies. This takes time and effort and is a particularly
                        significant burden for smaller organisations. We believe this is one of the reasons they are
                        being swallowed up by larger firms – it’s simply too hard to keep up.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Q: Why is Business Intelligence or analytics so crucial in this space?</strong></h3>
                    <p>A: Currently, we see a landscape of different technology – both across the sector as a whole and
                        within different organisations. Most of the clients we work with have a large number of
                        applications, often best of breed, line-of-business applications.</p>
                    <p>The advantage of business analytics is that we can correlate that data, link it together in a
                        meaningful way and provide useful analytics reporting. From a CIO perspective, harnessing that
                        data and the knowledge within that data is crucial for an aged care organisation to ensure it’s
                        on the right charter and going forward focusing on the right activities. Business Intelligence
                        tools offer a huge competitive advantage.</p>
                    <p>While integrated data isn’t yet a reality for most aged care businesses – or most businesses
                        generally – a Business Intelligence solution that’s backed by Power BI can bridge the gaps,
                        bringing information together for meaningful insight.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Q: Do you have an everyday example of how an aged care practice can use a Power BI
                            dashboard? </strong></h3>
                    <p>A: Often aged care businesses have a nurse call system and a rostering system and typically they
                        are completely disparate. However, through business analytics, we can identify trends between
                        these data sets and provide insights in a visual way. This can help managers to focus on what
                        they need to focus on to run the business and make good decisions about care, staffing levels
                        and overall productivity.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3><strong>Q: What are the benefits of business analytics for an aged care institution?</strong>
                    </h3>
                    <p>A: There are all kinds of great benefits. It can help workers at all levels to make faster and
                        more accurate decisions. It can improve care and reduce waiting times for residents, due to
                        improved efficiency and more streamlined rostering. And, all of this can also lead to increased
                        profitability and time savings across the organisation.</p>
                    <p>The more streamlined reporting and compliance process is also a huge benefit and time saving for
                        organisations; particularly smaller ones that need to be more judicious with their resource
                        allocation.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Business intelligence provides managers with the real-time, easy to understand, and relevant data
                        they need to manage proactively.&nbsp; You can’t manage what you don’t know.</p>
                    <p>Power BI brings obvious data into the spotlight and also shines a light on items that sometimes
                        fall through the cracks – from regulatory questions (such as the dates staff police checks need
                        renewing) to the quality of life questions like how many residents belong to a particular
                        religion or share similar hobbies.&nbsp; Imagine how this kind of information could be used to
                        help your residents more easily meet and make friends, and the ensuing quality of life
                        improvements.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Q: Who does a Business Intelligence solution benefit? </strong></h3>
                    <p>A: A Business Intelligence and analytics solution has a wide range of potential benefits across
                        the organisation. It provides a broad set of dashboards that are either role or regionally
                        based. So, a CEO might have different interests to a nursing manager, or a general manager of
                        facilities, or the chief operating officer. Essentially, we help create customised dashboards
                        for different roles, so everyone has the insight they need.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Q: What about the compliance and regulatory aspect? How can Business Intelligence
                            help?</strong></h3>
                    <p>A: Meeting increasing government regulations and requirements are becoming a significant
                        administrative overhead in the aged care sector.</p>
                    <p>For a start, there’s the need for organisations to continually report on the qualifications of
                        their staff. If you’re managing 2,000 employees, it’s vital to ensure they have all completed
                        police checks, done their first aid, or completed necessary qualifications. If you fail to meet
                        any of these requirements, you can get funding pulled, which can be a significant source of
                        revenue.</p>
                    <p>It’s what aged care organisations don’t know that will catch them. The more they can get on their
                        dashboard, the more they can get alerted before problems escalate.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Q: Why is Huon IT ideally placed to help?</strong></h3>
