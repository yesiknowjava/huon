                    <h2>12 Critical Questions to Ask Your Managed Services Provider</h2>
                    <p>Choosing the right Managed Services Provider (MSP) is an enormous decision for your company.
                        These days, technology is changing at a lightning-fast pace and more businesses, big and small,
                        are opting to partially or fully outsource their IT needs. Finding the right company to
                        outsource to is crucial. But as there are so many providers offering a broad range of
                        capabilities it can be hard to decide which MSPs are best for your business.</p>
                    <p>Whether you have an in-house IT team that just requires extra support, or you need an end-to-end
                        provider, you need to determine what questions to ask a potential MSP before signing a contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>We have created a detailed brochure and handy checklist outlining 12 critical questions you
                        should ask a potential Managed Services Provider.</p>
                    <p>Some of the questions to ask include:</p>
                    <h3>1. What kind of reputation and experience do they have?</h3>
                    <p>The last thing you want is for your MSP to be understaffed and underqualified.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You want at least a basic idea of the size of the team and their positions. What is the ratio of
                        IT experts to sales staff? You want to ensure that your MSP has a robust team that can cover all
                        your requirements.</p>
                    <p>How long has the company been in operation and what is their staff retention like? What
                        certifications do they hold? Do they follow best-practice ITIL methodologies?</p>
                    <h3>2. What do they outsource?</h3>
                    <p>Many MSPs white label our outsource certain&nbsp;services, using either local or offshore
                        resources. If the MSP does outsource some roles, find out exactly what functions are managed
                        externally. You may want to ask similar questions about the companies they outsource to. That
                        is, what experience do they have, where are they located, what are their SLAs?</p>
                    <p>If any issues arise, you want to make sure you know exactly how to call, and when. You also want
                        to know that there is constant monitoring and support available.</p>
