                    <p>Phishing scams are the most common scam impacting Australians. Australians lost more money to
                        scammers in 2017 than in any other year since reporting began by the <a
                            href="https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/F1240_Targeting%20scams%20report.PDF">ACCC</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h2><strong>So, what is phishing?</strong></h2>
                    <p>A <strong>phishing scam</strong> is where users are asked to divulge sensitive information such
                        as usernames, passwords and credit card details. Examples include fake security notice warnings
                        where users are warned about “unusual log-in activity”.</p>
                    <p>These messages pretend to come from legitimate businesses, normally banks, other financial
                        institutions (e.g. PayPal), or telecommunication providers.</p>
                    <p>The phishing scams can look extremely sophisticated and convincing. There is usually some form of
                        call-to-action tricking us into divulging sensitive personal information such as passwords or
                        bank details.</p>
                    <p>There are several types of phishing scams. In this post, we’ll look at the difference between two
                        common types: spear phishing and whaling.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3><strong>Spear phishing</strong></h3>
                    <p>Spear phishing is a much more targeted attack in which hackers know which specific individuals or
                        organisations they are after.</p>
                    <p>While ‘phishing’ casts a wide net and hopes to gather data from a wide set of people, spear
                        phishing is an attempt to gather data from an identified target.</p>
                    <p>Spear phishers are after valuable data such as confidential information and business secrets. The
                        cyber criminals do research on the target to make the attack more personalised and to increase
                        their chance of success.</p>
                    <p>Think of spear phishing as professional phishing.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3><strong>Whaling</strong></h3>
                    <p>Whaling follows on from the idea of spear phishing. The key difference is that the targets are
                        even more carefully selected. They are often senior executives such as CEOs or CFOs as they have
                        complete access to sensitive data.</p>
                    <p>It’s called ‘whaling’ because of the size of the targets relative to those of typical phishing
                        scams. This type of scam is also known as CEO Fraud or Executive Fraud.</p>
                    <p>Whaling attacks are more difficult to detect than typical phishing attacks because they are so
                        highly personalised and are only sent to the selected target within an organisation.</p>

                    <h3><strong>How to avoid phishing scams</strong></h3>
                    <p>You may not be able to prevent your staff from being targeted by cyber criminals but there are
                        steps you can take to reduce the likelihood that these attacks will be successful.</p>
                    <p>One of the most important steps you can take is to educate your staff on how to recognise
                        phishing scams and malicious attacks.</p>
                    <p>At Huon IT, we offer an effective 12-month Cybersecurity Awareness Training program. This program
                        is extremely successful in reducing your company’s risk. For more details, <a

                    </p>
                    <p>Some other steps you can take:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Never send out personal sensitive information via email.</li>
                        <li>Verify the contact details of the sender by calling the organisation directly. Find their
                            details through other methods such as search them online.</li>
                        <li>Look for the secure symbol on their website (https versus http).</li>
                        <li>Update your security software, change passwords and back-up content regularly.</li>
                        <li>Consider what personal and business information you post on social media. Scammers use
                            publicly available information to identify potential whaling and spear phishing victims.
                        </li>
