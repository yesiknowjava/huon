                    <p><strong>Huon IT is proud to announce that as of 1st July 2019, we are now a KYOCERA Group
                            Company; wholly owned by Kyocera Document Solutions Inc (Japan).</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Kyocera Corporation</strong> is a leading supplier of semiconductor packages, industrial
                        and automotive components, electronic devices, solar power generating systems and mobile phones.
                        During the year ended March 31, 2019, Kyocera Corporation’s consolidated sales revenue totalled
                        1.62 trillion yen (approx. US$14.6 billion). Kyocera appears on the “Derwent Top 100 Global
                        Innovators 2018-19” list by Clarivate Analytics and is ranked #655 on Forbes magazine’s 2019
                        “Global 2000” list of the world’s largest publicly traded companies.</p>
                    <p>A key part of that is<strong> Kyocera Document Solutions Inc; </strong>a leading provider of
                        document management solutions including&nbsp;reliable and eco-friendly MFPs and printers, as
                        well as&nbsp;business applications and consultative services which enable customers to optimize
                        and manage their document workflow, reaching new heights of efficiency.</p>
                    <p>And now locally, the acquisition of Huon IT significantly increases the capabilities of
                        <strong>KYOCERA Document Solutions ANZ</strong>, adding further value to its already extensive
                        product offering with the addition of ICT services for the local market.</p>
                    <p>The synergies between Kyocera and Huon IT are vast, including cultural alignment, a core focus on
                        client value, innovation, and similar client bases. Managing Director, Ryosuke Okochi, explains:
                        “The acquisition of Huon IT is part of Kyocera’s ongoing strategy to support Australian
                        businesses as we drive change and expand our own business.&nbsp;We are confident that we can add
                        value to our customers by expanding our product offering and a new choice in ICT services.&nbsp;
                        Huon IT services will integrate into our business offering with their high-performance ICT
                        solutions that complement our own values and commitment to our customers. We are extremely
                        excited to welcome Huon IT to Kyocera Document Solutions.”</p>
                    <p>And for Huon IT, this marks an exciting “next step” in the company’s journey. CEO &amp; Founder,
                        Damian Huon, reflects, “As we approach our 30th anniversary, we are honoured to have forged such
                        valuable relationships with a high calibre of clients, cultivated rewarding careers for our
                        talented employees, and developed an innovative solution portfolio across managed services,
                        projects and cloud, with the support of our trusted vendors.</p>
                    <p>I’m extremely proud of the Huon team who show exceptional commitment on a daily basis, and have
                        helped to shape the business into what it is today; with a culture of caring for clients’
                        businesses as if they were our own, and always supporting each other and the community.</p>
                    <p>Now with Kyocera’s support, we can reach heightened levels of innovation, expand our services,
                        and reach new locations and sectors. I’m incredibly honoured to now be part of the Kyocera
                        Group.”</p>
                    <p>Joining the Kyocera Group will provide the team at Huon IT more resources to innovate, to
                        ultimately deliver a wider range of effective ICT services for our clients.</p>
                    <p>There will be no change to operations, with Huon IT’s executive, management team and staff
                        remaining in place.</p>
                    <p>“Huon IT has seen significant growth in the past couple of financial years, so this integration
                        will galvanise the next phase of company growth, via national team expansion and introduction
                        into Kyocera’s strong client base,” adds Damian.</p>
                    <p>With a plan to expand the portfolio and open more locations across Australia, the future is
                        extremely bright for Huon IT as a Kyocera Group Company.&nbsp;</p>
