                        to share our thoughts on the top 5 tips for Teams!</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>What is Microsoft Teams?</strong></p>
                    <p>A market leading collaboration app, Microsoft Teams is designed specifically for the modern
                        workplace. Its integration with the Office suite of applications and Skype enable consistent
                        chat conversations at a team level as well as peer-to-peer in private forums. The Skype
                        integration enables users to transfer written chat to a voice or video conferencing call at the
                        click of a button. The option to utilise emojis, GIFs, stickers and custom memes gives users the
                        opportunity to add their own presence.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Here's why people are adopting it:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teams makes communicating one-on-one and with groups a snap</li>
                        <li>Collaboration happens in real time. Teams keeps people in the loop and can include screen
                            share, voice, the power of video communication and more</li>
                        <li>All your documents, edits and conversations can be worked on together through a single
                            platform.&nbsp;The central interactive hub provides a quicker decision making, reduces email
                            overload and eliminates distance issues.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Read on for our 5 hot tips for Teams! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>1. &nbsp;Email Relief</strong></p>
                    <p>Almost all of us receive an overwhelming number of emails.&nbsp;Move casual and project email
                        conversations to Teams. The interactive and visual medium of Teams is perfect for asking
                        teammates quick questions, engaging in a fast decision making back forth dialogue and moving the
                        social discussion from the one way medium of email to the more natural flow offered by Teams.
                    </p>
                    <p><br><strong>Send email to teams</strong> Keep all your team communications organised and
                        accessible in one place by sending pertinent emails to the relevant channel. To create a channel
                        email address right click on a channel and select <strong>“Get email address” </strong>in the
                        dropdown menu.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>2. &nbsp;Meetings in Moments</strong></p>
                    <p>You can start a voice or video call right from within the channel or private chat. Invite the
                        whole team, or just those you need, to video call, screen share and collaborate.</p>
                    <p><strong>Meet now</strong> by clicking on the video or voice call in the conversations tab, or
                        <strong>Schedule</strong> a meeting by clicking Meetings in the left navigation pane, then
                        clicking Schedule. You can stay in touch no matter where you are. The rich client, available for
                        both desktop and mobile platforms, gives you all the tools you need to stay part of the team</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>3. &nbsp;Automation</strong></p>
                    <p>Did you know you can create automated workflows between Teams and your favorite apps and services
                        to get notifications, synchronize files, collect data, and more?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Add a connector:</strong>&nbsp;Connectors send updates, dashboards and information
                        directly to your chosen channel, and include over 60 of your favourite services like Trello,
                        Asana, Salesforce, Google Analytics and more.&nbsp; <strong>To add</strong> go to a channel,
                        click the more icon next to the channel name, then select&nbsp;<strong>Connectors, </strong>or
                        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/connectors-dev-dashboard">create
                            your own</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Add a tab</strong>: tabs connect to other Microsoft services (like Excel, SharePoint,
                        Power BI, Visual Studio Team Services, Kanban boards and more), integrate third-party apps and
                        services (like Asana, YouTube, Zendesk, and more), or allow you to add a website of your choice
                        directly to a tab. <strong>You can add a tab</strong> to any channel by clicking the <strong>+
                            icon</strong> next to your tabs, or <a
                            href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/tabs">create your own</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Use a Flow Template: </strong>Like IFTTT, Flow enables you to create automated workflows
                        between apps and services.&nbsp; Use preset <a
                            href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/services/shared_teams/microsoft-teams/">Teams
                            templates</a>, or sign up/in and <a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/">create your
                            own</a>.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>4. &nbsp;Bandwidth</strong></p>
                    <p>The dynamic multimedia collaboration aspects of Teams cause some IT departments concern.&nbsp;Use
                        the <a href="https://www.successwithteams.com/BandwidthCalculator">bandwidth calculator</a> to
                        assess the approximate network traffic.&nbsp; If you are worried about bandwidth, the calls and
                        meetings section of Teams lets you <strong>choose</strong> if users will be allowed to video or
                        screen share during meetings.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>5. &nbsp;Tips for Successful Kickoff</strong></p>
                    <p>Even when something amazing comes along, changing habits can be hard
                        work.<br><strong>Tips</strong> for a successful kickoff include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Begin with 2 or 3 pilot groups – let word of mouth prime the rest of the team</li>
                        <li>Identify team champions – charge them with encouraging others</li>
                        <li>Pre populate channels with interesting content</li>
                        <li>Clearly define each team and channels purpose – set goals and add this in the title and
                            description field – ie: “Fun” Looking for 10 great ideas for fun company social events to be
                            held throughout the year</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Ask team members to commit to a “Teams first” approach - using Microsoft Teams as the primary way
                        to communicate with each other and collaborate on projects<br><br>
